Convention Guide data conversion scripts
========================================

This package helps automate the creation of the Convention Guide
(a.k.a. Pocket Program) for science fiction conventions. It takes a .csv
or .xml file of raw schedule information, and reformats it in several ways
for inclusion into an InDesign document.
